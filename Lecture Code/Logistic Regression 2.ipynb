    "In this session, we want to see Logistic Regression in action. On top of it, we want to have our first pass on cross validation, a model validation technique which is used extensively. In many works related with machine learning, specially on the more academic side, we are not only interested in how our model under test performs, but also how it performance compares to that of some other alternatives. All the other alternatives are called _baseline_ in machine learning literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline comparison enables us to gain a better understanding of the toughness of the task at hand and also helps us evaluate the trade-offs better. For example, let's say we are measuring performance by AUROC. Let's assume the model we are developing has an AUROC of 0.95 and a one of our baselines has an AUROC of 0.93. This shows we have made an improvement over what has been already there. However, let's say our model takes 2 days to train whereas our baseline takes 10 minutes. Depending on the application, it might be worth it to compromise the AUROC by 0.02 and stick to the model that takes less.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case of Logistic Regression, we are using Ridge Regression, and LASSO Regression as the baselines. We do not expand upon what they are here and we encourage the reader to figure them out on their own if interested. The comparison will be made based on AUROC and the absolute value of coefficients of each model (a measure of _overfitness_). \n",
    "\n",
    "We also learn a simple method for handling missing values which is removing such records. We also see how one hot encoding is performed. Nearly all models in Python want the labels of the dataset to be numerical so we see a method to do so. We then perform a stratified K-fold cross-validation to compare the AUROC among the three aforementioned models. For two of them we do an internal grid search in advance. After obtaining best hyperparameters, we train three final models to compare the coefficients obtained by each model. Therefore, this week we learn:\n",
    "* Dropping: a simple way of handling missingness in data\n",
    "* One-hot encoding\n",
    "* Changing the label to the right format\n",
    "* Stratified K-fold for obtaining average AUROC for Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, and LASSO Regression\n",
    "* Internal grid search for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "* Coefficient comparison among different models"
