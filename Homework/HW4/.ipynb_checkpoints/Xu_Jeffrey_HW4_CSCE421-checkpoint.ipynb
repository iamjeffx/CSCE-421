    "**1. Comparing standard normalization to PCA-shpering on MNIST:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare a run of then gradient descent steps using the multi-class Softmax cost over 50,000 random digits from the MNIST dataset (introduced in Example 7.10), a standard normalized version, and a PCA-sphered version of the data. For each run use the largest fixed steplength of the form $\\alpha=10^{\\gamma}$ for $\\gamma$ an integer you find to produce the descent. Create a plot comparing the progress of each run in terms of the cost function and number of misclassifications. Additionally, make sure your initialization of each run is rather small, particularly the first run where you apply no normalization at all to the input as each raw input point of this dataset is large in magnitude. In the case of the raw data initializing at a point too far away from the origin can easily cause numerical overflow, producing **nan** or **inf** values, ruining the rest of the corresponding local optimization run.

This dataset contains images of the faces of 15 individuals. For each individual there are 11 images taken under a variety of conditions e.g., the person makes a happy expression, wears glasses, etc.\n",

Assume that the input vector of PCA contains all rows of an image stacked one on top of the other. You can use available libraries that calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. *Hint:* Don't forget to normalize the data. "

How many components do we need to achieve a visually good result? *Hint:* Reconstruction of an input vector **x** based on the eigenvectors $u_{1},...,u_{k}$ is given by the following expression $x\\approx x_{0}+\\sum_{k=1}^{K}$, where $c_{k}=u_{k}^{T}x$ is the projection of the input image to the $k^{th}$ eigenvector.
